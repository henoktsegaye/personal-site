Javascript has primitive types that constitute the basis of all data types in the language.
everything else in javascript is an object like functions classes ( in es6) or arrays.
you can tell this by just looking at the typeof operator.

```
typeof 'hello' // string
typeof true // boolean
typeof 1 // number
typeof {} // object
typeof null // object
typeof undefined // undefined
typeof function () {} // function
typeof Symbol('hello') // symbol
```

But here `typeof null` is an object which is not actully true since null is a primitive type.

```
typeof null // object
```

this is considered a bug in javascript.

well if primitives are not Objects you might ask how are we accessing properties of them.

```
'hello'.length // 5
```

this is not a bug in javascript :)
This is actully one of the features of javascript. It maps out primitive types to **_Wrapper Objects_** which is the reason we can see the `length` property of a string.
Which will actully create a new object and with value as "hello" , so you can access the length property of the object.
But once we had access the property of the object Garbage Collector will remove the object from memory.

Those primitive types are directly map to the types in the language. Which are
Javascript has 7 primitive types:

- undefined
- null
- boolean
- number
- string
- symbol
- object

## Primitive Types properties

## Primitive Types are Immutable

Javascript primitive types are immutable. meaning you cannot change the value of a primitive type.
which is differnt from the immutable nature of objects. as objects are mutable.
Objects are reference types , which means you can change the value of the object. but primitive types are not reference types. but value types.
```
var a = 1; 
var b = a; 
a = 2; 
console.log(a); // 2 
console.log(b); // 1 
```

when assigning a primitive type to a variable , the value of the variable is copied and the variable is not a reference to the value of the primitive type which means you can change the value of the variable and that won't be reflected
But what happens when you re-assign the primitive type to a variable?
that value would be destroyed and new value would be assigned to the variable.
