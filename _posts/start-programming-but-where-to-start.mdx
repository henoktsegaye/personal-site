## Why do you want to start Coding.


I mean don't get me wrong I like the idea of someone starting to code and understand technology in general
but sometimes people get into it not knowing why they are doing it, some might start because some one do it others well cause it looks cool.
am not saying one is a good reason to start and the others are not but doing it to impress people or for others pleasure in whatsoever way is not going to last, neither is that a good cause.
If you are doing this because this is cool or you think its interesting I think that is enough, you don't have to had a crazy story that inspire you to starte coding. But I will say one thing and that is **make sure you are doing it for you**.

## OK, so where should I start tho ?

If you are a student already , you are in luck because you might already know how to start coding, **Learning Online** .you can learn stuff online but one of the biggest way to learn programming would be to enroll in computer science or a related fields. 
But most of us want to get started as fast as possible and the world is moving too fast. This is where the resources on the internet seem overwhelmin, and prople seem to have diffrent opinions about the best track to get there ( be a software engnieer).

People always seem to be impressed with new technology specially in programming, you can see this everywhere people seem to be learning javascript lately starting about 2018 or 2017, javascript seems hot right now so one might learn it because of the hype.
For me I think its really better to start learning programming from c++. C++ is really helpful because it teaches you how to program, most of the famous programming languages also use a C-like programming syntax so you won't get in trouble when learning them. besides C++ will teach you the basics of programming that you will find everywhere. 
for example pointers starters might find it difficult to get to know pointers but once you grasp the idea you can even relate this idea else where like javascript how object referrence works.

also its just better to start from the fundamentals from one book or two **Take your time to learn things**. Let's try not to rush and try to write a code that can hack Nasa. Let's start small understand what computers are, what are they made of , what is programming. This very basic quations are the one that can take you a distance if you answer them properly. But usually nobody wants to study those topics people are busy getting confused trying to write a code they don't understand.
** Take your time to understand the Basics**

`Take Your time to understand the Basics!`

## What are the basics?

---

The Basic starts off with what a computer is. Understanding a computer is the basic of learning programming. Understanding The basic of computer works to what a memory is to learning how memory allocation works will help you understand your code better.
Beyond that diving into what a computer program is would start by understanding algorithm. **a computer program is just an algorithm that is meant to be for computers.** you can kick this off with the basic understanding of algorithms. understanding flow charts can be a starter.
