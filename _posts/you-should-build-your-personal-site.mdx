There are a couple of reasons you should build your own site.

- You own your own content.
- Free Share and free policy for your content.
- You can tell your story regardless.
- **You don't have a restriction what you share**

---
on the 4th list i want to elaborate. so if you post content on instagram, your post is gong to be image centric or if you post content on twitter its somehow text centeric. but those restrictions might not be as clear cut as they are but we all know them deep inside. if you just want to share content regardless then this is your place.

## The way to do it!

Just go small you can host your stuff on wordpress or you can do a simple site no need to go complex in the start.
