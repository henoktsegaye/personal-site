## ** Zemach-Cast ** is a podcast deployment platform.

Zemach-cast was built base on our experience building [Zemach FM](https://zemachfm.com) website and managing and publishing pocasts on diffrent platforms.

Zemach-Cast is a platform that will take care of those things for people that have pocasts, zemach-cast also gives the podcast host a unique website that fits the brand.

## How was the **platform** built.

well, i encourge you too see it there [link](https://zemach-cast.zemachfm.com/). so building the platform wasn't challenging as we already know what it meant to build a platform for zemach fm, we added that and other knowladges to build this awesome platform.

We build the site with my colleague and freind [abdulhamid](https://abdulhamid.et). we used [next js](https://nextjs.com) [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) and others for the platform.
