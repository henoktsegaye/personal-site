### **Zeamch FM** is the first tech podcast in Ethiopia.

Zemach FM aims at improving the way we think use consume technology. Technology is the aim.
This was one of the ideas we had with [abdulhamid](https://abdulhamid.et), the aim was to tech about tech more ofter just like we do in real life. It started just like that. now we have reache 50 episodes each having its own news section ( each episode have a discussion + news section).
Its really amazing how far we have come with this podcast and we aim to expand our media to others as well.

well, i encourge you too see it  [here](https://zemachfm.com). Building a website for this podcast was a challanging one because of a couple of reasons one being that we should reflect what we wanted to convey, and also since we are a podcast we wanted to make the webiste sound freindly.

</div>


We build the site with my colleague and freind [abdulhamid](https://abdulhamid.et) .when we got started with the podcast our aim was to take our conversation that we always talked about in our daily life to the internet.
when we decided we wanted to do so we also belived we are doing this for ourselves also we will explore tech topics on each weekend which will increase our knowladge on the topics we choose and we will keep ourself updated
on what is going on in tech.

### Technologies used
