A project under [addissoftware](https://addissoftware.com).
All-in Global is a website for a language translation and localization company. 
### **Tech Used**
developed the project using Bootstrap, jQuery, JavaScript, CSS, PHP, and WordPress according to the company's predefined design. The project has a CI/CD for the staging environment, and I used DigitalOcean to deploy it. After deploying the website, the company started scoring on predeÔ¨Åned keywords on Google and increasing its revenue.
