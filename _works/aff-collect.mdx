A tracking system for affiliate programs.
A project under [addissoftware](https://addissoftware.com).


Oversaw a team of three developers creating an aﬃliate revenue tracking and management system that works by scraping aﬃliate programs daily and monthly and aggregating the data to show relevant information. It can communicate with 12 aﬃliate programs that do not have API by logging in, scraping, and sending an invoice for scraped content.
### Tech used
We developed the API using Node.js, the front end with TypeScript, React, Redux, Redux-saga, and Ant Design, and for the scraper, we used a cron job written using Node.js. The cron job reports' failed attempts give notiﬁcations. This project also uses GitLab CI/CD and deploys the changes on the server set up on DigitalOcean. The Docker and Docker Compose were set up to run multiple Docker instances on both staging and production environments for the back and front ends.
