## A tracking system for affiliate programs

wAff colelct is a project i have done under [addissoftware](https://addissoftware.com).
In this project i was a lead engineer at the company, the main aim of the project
was to help clients manage their affilate buisness easily using the application.

Clients requested this product because it was hard for them to track each earning
they get from different affilate platforms. This system will do the tracking with
a cron job that does the scrapping.

### Tech used

The Project primarly used [React](https://react.com) for the front end and this was the part i was usually involved in. and used [node js](https://nodejs.com) for the backend.
in the front end we also used [Redux](https://redux.com) and [Redux Saga](https://redux-saga.com).
