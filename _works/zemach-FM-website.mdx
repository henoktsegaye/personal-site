**Zeamch FM's** aim is really easy. 

It aims at improving the way we think use consume technology. Technology is the aim.

 well, i encourge you too see it there [link](https://zemachfm.com). so building a website for this podcast was a challanging one because of a couple of reasons one being that we should reflect what we wanted to convey, and also since we are a podcast we wanted to make the webiste sound freindly.

We build the site with my colleague and freind [abdulhamid](https://abdulhamid.et) .when we got started with the podcast our aim was to take our conversation that we always talked about in our daily life to the internet.
when we decided we wanted to do so we also belived we are doing this for ourselves also we will explore tech topics on each weekend which will increase our knowladge on the topics we choose and we will keep ourself updated 
on what is going on in tech.

now its about a year since we started our podcast and we want to keep making more.
