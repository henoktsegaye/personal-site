**Zeamch FM's** aim is really easy. 

It aims at improving the way we think use consume technology. Technology is the aim.

 well, i encourge you too see it there [link](https://zemachfm.com). so building a website for this podcast was a challanging one because of a couple of reasons 
one being that we should reflect what we wanted to convey, and also since we are a podcast we wanted to make the webiste sound freindly.
