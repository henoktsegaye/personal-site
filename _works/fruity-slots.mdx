Fruity Slots is a WordPress SEO-driven website with a developed theme. I made this website for a company under Addis Software to score on search engines.
### Tech Stacks
 I created a content management system (CMS) for seven items that the website managed using WordPress and ACF plugins. Custom plugins were added for bulk page creation using comma-separated values (CSV) upload and MySQL for data storage. I implemented rich results for search engines and gave generalized content data. The front end was developed using customized Bootstrap, Sass, and custom CSS, and it employed jQuery, JavaScript, and Vue.js. Finally, I created a CI/CD solution for the staging to see the changes before merging the staging into production developed using Nginx.

The company scored on search engines with keywords and expanded their reviewed items
